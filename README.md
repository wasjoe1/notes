# NOTES

## Description
This folder contains notes for anything computing related.

Some common files that i keep out of any specific folders are
- notes                     => generic notes that i can lookup quickly
- useful_terminal_commands  => common terminal cmds for debugging; can quickly lookup
- vscode_shortcuts          => common vscode shortcuts coz im lazy=; can quickly lookup

## Acronyms
UTH - under the hood

## Notations
- __BOLD__
- ~~strikethrough~~
- i.e. - example
- ; - spacer before next point
- => relate
- - bullet point

## Additional notes
This could potentially become a project where i sync my notes into a UI, and this program will render markdown notations into visually styled texts.
(i.e. bolding on .md files look like __this__ or **this**; the integration would make this to actually be displayed as a bolded word & ** could redefined for other purposes)

I could do what sphinx does for python documnetation where it hosts a site with the rendered UI.
