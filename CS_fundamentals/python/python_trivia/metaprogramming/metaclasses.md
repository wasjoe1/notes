# metaprogramming
* metaprogramming - potential for a program to have knowledge of OR manipulate itself

python supports a form of metaprogramming for classes called metaclasses
- metaclasses are an esoteric OOP concept => esoteric: intended to be understood by only a small # of ppl
- it is a capability not all OOP languages support => but python does
- can get UTH & define custom metaclasses

* to note: in python everything is an object
