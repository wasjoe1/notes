metaprogramming covers 3 topics:
1. metaclasses: https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/ => code that control how classes themselves are created
2. descriptors: https://realpython.com/python-descriptors/=> objects that customize attribute access behavior; turns static data fields into dynamix entry points
3. dynamic code exec:
