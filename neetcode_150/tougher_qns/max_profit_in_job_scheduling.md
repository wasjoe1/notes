- iterators & iterable:
    - zip(arr1, arr2) # returns `[(arr1[0], arr2[0]), (arr1[1], arr2[1]), …]`
    - zipped objects are iterators which will get exhausted, they have `iter()` & `next()`
    - whereas iterable objects like list will not get exhausted but only has `iter()`
    - `y = iter(zipped_obj)` ⇒ `y == zipped_obj` ; basically nth happens & if u exhaust y, zipped_object is also exhaust
    * check notes on `sort` & `bisect` (binary search) > search for time ≥ to a target time
